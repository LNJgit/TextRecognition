# TextRecognition
A Python project that uses EasyOCR and OpenCV to detect and correct text in images, with support for face detection and blurring. Detected text is stored in a PostgreSQL database with searchable word-level indexing. The project supports GPU acceleration for faster OCR and includes tools for displaying or updating processed images from a folder.
